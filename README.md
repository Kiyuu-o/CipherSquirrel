## OverView

This project is a simple command-line file encryption program written in C99. It provides basic encryption and decryption functionality using symmetric encryption algorithms.

## Key Features

- Encryption Algorithm: Implement a modified version of ChaCha20.

- User Interface: Command-line interface for users to specify the file to encrypt/decrypt and the encryption key.

- Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully, such as file not found, insufficient permissions, or incorrect key format.

## How to Use
