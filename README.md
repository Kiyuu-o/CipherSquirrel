## OverView

This project is a simple command-line file encryption program written in C99. It provides basic encryption and decryption functionality using symmetric encryption algorithms.

## Key Features

<!-- - File Handling: Read from and write to files in binary mode. -->

- Encryption Algorithm: Implement a basic version of AES (or start with a simpler algorithm like XOR-based encryption for learning purposes).

- User Interface: Command-line interface for users to specify the file to encrypt/decrypt and the encryption key.

- Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully, such as file not found, insufficient permissions, or incorrect key format.

<!-- - Testing and Documentation: Write test cases to verify the correctness of encryption and decryption. Document code thoroughly, explaining the encryption algorithm used and how to use the program. -->

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the source code using a gcc compiler.

3. Run the executable and follow the command-line instructions to encrypt/decrypt files.
